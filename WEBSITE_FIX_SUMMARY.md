# Website Fix Summary - July 1, 2025

## 🔧 Issues Fixed

### ❌ **Primary Issue: Import Error**
The website wasn't working due to an invalid import statement in the OrderContext that was trying to import a function from an API route file, which is not allowed in Next.js.

**Error Location:**
```typescript
// ❌ This was causing the issue
import { generateDownloadToken } from '@/app/api/download/[token]/route';
```

### ✅ **Solution Implemented**

#### 1. **Created Utility File** (`/src/lib/downloadUtils.ts`)
- Extracted download token generation and validation logic into a separate utility file
- Created proper interfaces and functions that can be imported by both client-side and API code
- Implemented secure token management with expiration and download limits

#### 2. **Updated OrderContext** (`/src/lib/OrderContext.tsx`)
- Fixed import to use the new utility file:
```typescript
// ✅ Fixed import
import { generateDownloadToken } from './downloadUtils';
```

#### 3. **Updated API Route** (`/src/app/api/download/[token]/route.ts`)
- Refactored to use utility functions for consistency
- Removed duplicate code and improved maintainability
- Fixed token validation and download count management
